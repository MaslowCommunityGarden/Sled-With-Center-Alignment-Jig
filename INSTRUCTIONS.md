1. Leave the router bit you used to cut out this sled chucked up in your router
1. Attach the ring as you normally would (using the alignment holes for guidance)
1. Place the router bit through the center hole to ensure perfect alignment and attach the router base
1. Remove the router from the base and knock out the central puck which is held in place with thin tabs
1. Re-insert the router into the base and you are all set

One question in these instructions is that you can nolonger use the plastic base of the router as a drilling guide, how do you mark and accurately drill the holes for the router? Please propose edits to this page with recomendations.
