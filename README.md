# Sled With Center Alignment Jig

A version of the sled which leaves in the center part to help with router alignment

This version of the sled leaves the middle puck in place and adds a center hole which can be used to help align the router on the sled.

The original credit for this idea goes to [Stephen_Slagle](https://forums.maslowcnc.com/t/centering-the-router-on-the-sled/3292) who proposed the idea.
